## Background

** **CRUD stands for Create, Remove, Update, and Delete.**

Sophomore Year: I utilized C programming within a virtual machine UNIX enviroment and implemented a CRUD device using Linux tools and C code. The CRUD device stressed proper memory allocation for each byte of information and utilized Network programming to communicate information between a client and server.

Due to academic Policy, I am not allowed to share the code online and will have to share code through email or other methods with verification.
