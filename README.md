**Course Description**: Introduction to Systems Programming using C and Linux with Memory allocation and Network Programming.

## Project Information:

To create a block storage device that can also communicate information between a client and server. I basically coded a program that can create files, remove files, update file contents, and delete files.

## Project Background

** **CRUD stands for Create, Remove, Update, and Delete.**

Sophomore Year: I utilized C programming within a virtual machine UNIX enviroment and implemented a CRUD device using Linux tools and C code. The CRUD device stressed proper memory allocation for each byte of information and utilized Network programming to communicate information between a client and server. 

Due to academic Policy, I am not allowed to share the code online and will have to share code through email or other methods.

### Software used
