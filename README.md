# What is CRUD/HDD?

CRUD is an acroynm for "Create, Remove, Update, and Delete".

HDD is an acroynm for "Hard disk drive"

The project uses the model/idea of a block storage device and asks for implementation of coded functions that mimics standard C file commands (open, close, read, write, and seek). To summarize, My application will act like a driver for the HDD device.


- Memory management
- 


## How does this work?

**_For a more in-depth description of the application and what I needed to do, please look at the assignment PDFs_**

ll remaining assignments for this class are based upon you providing an easily used set of functions
so that an application that uses your code can easily talk to an external block storage device like a hard drive
(HDD).

This device already has its own pre-defined set of functions that allows communication with it.



## Important Concepts from Class utilized in this Project.

## Project Background

** **CRUD stands for Create, Remove, Update, and Delete.**

Sophomore Year: I utilized C programming within a virtual machine UNIX enviroment and implemented a CRUD device using Linux tools and C code. The CRUD device stressed proper memory allocation for each byte of information and utilized Network programming to communicate information between a client and server. 



### Software used

VM-ware: Linux 64 bit
